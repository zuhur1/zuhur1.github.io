Minefield Project
Overview
The Minefield Project is a java-based program that simulates a Minefield
game. 

Features
- Minefield Generation: A dynamically generated grid populated with mines based 
on user-defined parameters
- Gameplay Logic: Players interact with the grid to uncover tiles, mark potential mines, 
and avoid triggering explosions
- Win/Lose Conditions: The game tracks progress and determines victory or defeat based on
uncovering all non-mine tiles or activating a mine
- Input Handling: The program uses java.util.Scanner to accept play inputs and manage interaction during the game
